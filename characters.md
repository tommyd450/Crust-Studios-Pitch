## Knight

The knight is a core member of the group of adventurers sent out to investigate planets for the possibility of colonisation. 
Even though his codename may be The Knight, the only things he shares with a knight are his sense of justice and morality and his combat prowess. 
Favouring guns instead of swords and shields, the knight prefers to deal with problems head on without thinking much about them. 
His main role in the group is to deal with any combat relate issues such as taking care of enemies with speed and efficiency or 
taking on foes that are too strong for his comrades The Spelunker and The Scientist. He can also move around boulders and other large structures due to his high strength.

The Knight’s main motivation is to serve his King who sent him on this mission, ready to put his very life on the line for the sake of the mission. 
He is a tall, tanned hunk of pure muscle, with short hair. Wearing special armour that is both flexible and has high defence, the knight can tank a 
lot of damage as well as quickly dodge out of the way. He dreams that one day he will be able to serve as the top commander in the King’s elite bodyguards 
and as such he will take on any task given to him no matter how dirty or dangerous. The knight always puts others before himself, ready to put his life on 
the line for his teammates. Being such a morally right person, he despises people with no loyalty and those that have no problem sacrificing fellow teammates 
to achieve what they want. Its these characteristics that gave him the nickname of “The Knight”.

## Scientist

The scientist is a highly intelligent problem solver that has inventions ready for any situation. He uses his inventions to support his team. 
Ever since he was young, he has been experimenting with new inventions to improve his family and friends lives. The scientist prefers to work out 
and plan his actions methodically instead of just taking actions spontaneously. He wears a long white lab coat, a utility belt, and black glasses. 
He is a tall and pale looking man with the power to analyse his environment and take the best action for himself and the team. He always puts logic 
ahead of everything else. Because of this, he appears emotionless but sees himself as the one responsible for everyone’s lives and always uses his 
knowledge to guide his teammates. He tends to stay out of combat when he can, leaving that to the skilled team members such as the knight. He practices 
his inventing skills every day, constantly experimenting and striving for improvement to become an irreplaceable and valuable member on the team.

The scientist’s main motivation is making other people’s lives easier with his inventions and helping people when he can with his vast problem solving 
and puzzle skills. He is constantly looking for puzzles and problems to solve to keep his mind awake and ticking. He wishes to explore the deep space around 
him, in search for new materials and elements that he can then study and use for future inventions. He wants to be remembered for his contributions to guiding 
his team, discovering new planets and materials, and his contributions to society with his ground-breaking inventions that will assist many people in their lives.

## Spelunker

The spelunker is an intrepid explorer always prepared for whatever the environment throws at them having everything they’ll need on them or at least nearby. 
Since a young age the spelunker has always been a very curious person since an early age has always been the person to take the road less travelled by just 
out of sheer curiosity, always taking the longest route to somewhere just see what that route has to offer. Eventually they would train in various forms of 
navigation and traversal leaving almost no environment on their home-world that the spelunker could not travel across. From there many years of exploring and 
traversing the Spelunker gained a great interest in cave’s and there composition. There homeworld had however already been fully explored and mapped long 
before they were born. Longing to be remembered alongside those famous explorers the Spelunker set their eyes to the stars. A huge universe with billions 
upon billions of planets ripe for exploration and mapping. With all of there accumulated knowledge the spelunker hopes that they can use it to help them 
traverse alien worlds in the hopes of being remembered as a legendary explorer who went above and beyond. However upon the beginning of their expedition 
the spelunker began to realise that space exploration wasn’t as exciting as they thought it would be.
