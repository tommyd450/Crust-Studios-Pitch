## Knight

The knight is a core member of the group of adventurers sent out to investigate planets for the possibility of colonisation. 
Even though his codename may be The Knight, the only things he shares with a knight are his sense of justice and morality and his combat prowess. 
Favouring guns instead of swords and shields, the knight prefers to deal with problems head on without thinking much about them. 
His main role in the group is to deal with any combat relate issues such as taking care of enemies with speed and efficiency or 
taking on foes that are too strong for his comrades The Spelunker and The Scientist. He can also move around boulders and other large structures due to his high strength.

The Knight’s main motivation is to serve his King who sent him on this mission, ready to put his very life on the line for the sake of the mission. 
He is a tall, tanned hunk of pure muscle, with short hair. Wearing special armour that is both flexible and has high defence, the knight can tank a 
lot of damage as well as quickly dodge out of the way. He dreams that one day he will be able to serve as the top commander in the King’s elite bodyguards 
and as such he will take on any task given to him no matter how dirty or dangerous. The knight always puts others before himself, ready to put his life on 
the line for his teammates. Being such a morally right person, he despises people with no loyalty and those that have no problem sacrificing fellow teammates 
to achieve what they want. Its these characteristics that gave him the nickname of “The Knight”.

## Scientist

The scientist is a highly intelligent problem solver that has inventions ready for any situation. He uses his inventions to support his team. 
Ever since he was young, he has been experimenting with new inventions to improve his family and friends lives. The scientist prefers to work out 
and plan his actions methodically instead of just taking actions spontaneously. He wears a long white lab coat, a utility belt, and black glasses. 
He is a tall and pale looking man with the power to analyse his environment and take the best action for himself and the team. He always puts logic 
ahead of everything else. Because of this, he appears emotionless but sees himself as the one responsible for everyone’s lives and always uses his 
knowledge to guide his teammates. He tends to stay out of combat when he can, leaving that to the skilled team members such as the knight. He practices 
his inventing skills every day, constantly experimenting and striving for improvement to become an irreplaceable and valuable member on the team.

The scientist’s main motivation is making other people’s lives easier with his inventions and helping people when he can with his vast problem solving 
and puzzle skills. He is constantly looking for puzzles and problems to solve to keep his mind awake and ticking. He wishes to explore the deep space around 
him, in search for new materials and elements that he can then study and use for future inventions. He wants to be remembered for his contributions to guiding 
his team, discovering new planets and materials, and his contributions to society with his ground-breaking inventions that will assist many people in their lives.

## Spelunker

The spelunker is an intrepid explorer always prepared for whatever the environment throws at them having everything they’ll need on them or at least nearby. 
Since a young age the spelunker has always been a very curious person since an early age has always been the person to take the road less travelled by just 
out of sheer curiosity, always taking the longest route to somewhere just see what that route has to offer. Eventually they would train in various forms of 
navigation and traversal leaving almost no environment on their home-world that the spelunker could not travel across. From there many years of exploring and 
traversing the Spelunker gained a great interest in cave’s and there composition. There homeworld had however already been fully explored and mapped long 
before they were born. Longing to be remembered alongside those famous explorers the Spelunker set their eyes to the stars. A huge universe with billions 
upon billions of planets ripe for exploration and mapping. With all of there accumulated knowledge the spelunker hopes that they can use it to help them 
traverse alien worlds in the hopes of being remembered as a legendary explorer who went above and beyond. However upon the beginning of their expedition 
the spelunker began to realise that space exploration wasn’t as exciting as they thought it would be.

## Story Synopsis

### Act 1

The party of 3 are flying through space, looking for new inhabitable planets to mark for future colonisation. During their mission, they happen upon a planet with unprecedented seismic activity. The scientist pushes the party to go and investigate said activity. As they approach the planet, the spaceship is violently pulled towards the planet’s surface and crashes. Cuts to black and a few hours pass.
When we come back to our heroes, they’re bruised and scarred but nothing serious. With great effort they crawl out of the spaceship. They take in their surroundings. Colossal mountains surround them, and the landscape itself is very rocky and devoid of vegetation. The scientist scans the horizon for any points of interest and notices that in one of the distant mountain faces lies a decrepit, ancient temple carved into the mountain side. The scientist tells the knight and spelunker to head in and investigate while he works on the ship. The two make their way into the temple. Upon entering, the two find themselves in a vast open chamber with crumbling pillars lining the centre path. At the centre of the chamber, floats a mysterious, white orb. The orb pulses periodically creating powerful vibrations. The two approach the orb with caution, observing the orb. While the spelunker is pacing around, thinking to himself, the knight mindlessly reaches for the orb. Upon touch, the orb changes to red and cracks open. Evil spirits rush out of the orb, draining the orb of its red colour and leaving it clear. The Temple begins to collapse, and our heroes make their way out. 

### Act 2

Cut to scientist fixing the ship, as he finishes the repairs, he hears a loud rumbling. He turns around and sees the ancient temple crumble in the distance with red smoke arising from the cracks. The knight and spelunker come rushing back and urge the scientist to head inside the spaceship and lift off. As the scientist starts the spaceship, the red smoke forms a thick barrier in the atmosphere, the party tries to fly into space but are quickly stopped by said barrier. Floating mid-air the party is forced to watch a part of the smoke transform and take shape of each party member. The silhouettes separate and each one plunges into the ground, raising new temples in the spots they struck. Knowing they can’t escape, our adventurers land once again, determined to reseal the evil. 
The party makes their way through each one of the temples, the objective in each temple is to use the orb at the end to reseal each respective spirit.

#### Scientist Temple:

This temple is filled with traps and puzzles that mainly the scientist can solve with the help of the knight and spelunker. At the end, the party must solve the most difficult puzzle yet, by solving it, they get access to the orb that reseals the scientist’s silhouette. 
#### Spelunker Temple:

This temple will be heavily based on parkour and scaling obstacles, the spelunker will be of most help here, with the occasional help from his party using their own abilities. At the end, the party will have to scale to the top of the temple, where they will find the orb to reseal the spelunker’s silhouette.
#### Knight Temple:

The knights temple will put a heavy emphasis on combat, where the knight will be the centre character. The scientist and spelunker will provide backup. At the end of this temple the knight and his party members must fight off a horde of smoke demons to get to the orb to reseal the knight’s silhouette. 
When the third tower is complete, a 4th bigger tower comes up from the ground, with a large translucent orb floating on top of it. Our heroes make their way to it, upon entrance, the doors of the tower seal shut, locking the heroes inside. The heroes make their way through the temple using all the skills and abilities they learned in the previous temples. Once at the top, the heroes have the orb in their sight and upon approaching they get interrupted by an amalgamation of all 3 previous silhouettes. 

### Act 3

Upon defeating the last spirit, the knight makes his way to grab the orb. Before touching it, the scientist stops him and directs his attention to a mural behind the orb. On the mural is a depiction of a man holding the orb and having his life sucked out. Upon discussing the issue, the knight takes on the responsibility of sacrificing himself to reseal the evil spirit. He does this to redeem himself for being the one who released it in the first place. The knight sacrifices himself and all the smoke gets sucked back into the orb. Once all the smoke is sucked back into the orb, the knights body collapses and turns into dust and another strong wave of vibrations occurs. Shaking the foundations of the temples and crumbling them do the ground. The scientist and spelunker quickly make their way down the temple, making it just in time before the temple fully collapses. The two get into the spaceship and leave the planet.
